**🔗 Based on:** [Unit 2 – Get Started with Object Detection]

A real-time web application that uses **TensorFlow.js** and **React.js** to detect multiple objects in webcam feed or static images using the **COCO-SSD** pre-trained model. Fully runs in the browser with no backend.

**Features:**
- Real-time object detection via webcam
- Browser-based TensorFlow.js model execution
- Clean React.js UI with bounding box overlays
- Uses the COCO-SSD model (80 common object classes)

> ✅ *Status: Completed*




### 🧠 2. Recyclable vs Non-Recyclable Classifier (Python)

**🔗 Based on:** [Unit 6 – Going Further with Image Classification]

This project is a custom image classifier that detects whether an item belongs to the **recyclable** or **non-recyclable** category. Built using Python and TensorFlow, it promotes eco-friendly practices by assisting in waste categorization.

**Features:**
- Binary classification using a trained image model
- Clean UI for testing with user-uploaded images
- Accurate and fast predictions on custom dataset

**🔗 Based on:** Entire Virtual Internship

This all-in-one **Smart Desk Classifier** project was developed during the **Deloitte Technology Job Simulation**, organized by **Deloitte** and **Forage**. It combines:

- **🔍 Object Detection**: Identifying desk items in real time  
- **♻ Image Classification**: Determining recyclability of uploaded images  

Both modules are powered by **Python** and built upon Deloitte's pathway units for Object Detection (Unit 2) and Image Classification (Unit 6).

**Features:**
- Binary classification using a trained image model
- Clean UI for testing with user-uploaded images
- Accurate and fast predictions on custom dataset

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (v2+)
- **OpenCV**, **NumPy**
- **Streamlit** (web UI)
- **Pre-trained COCO-SSD model**
- **Custom CNN model** (`recycle_classifier.h5`)
- 

## 🎯 Key Features :

### 🔍 Object Detection
- Real-time detection of common desk items: laptop, pen, bottle, etc.
- Utilizes a pre-trained COCO-SSD model for bounding box visualization.
- Runs on webcam input or static images.

### ♻ Image Classification
- Accepts user-uploaded waste images via browser UI.
- Classifies into 7 categories, then maps to _Recyclable_ or _Non‑Recyclable_.
- Provides quick and accurate classification results.
